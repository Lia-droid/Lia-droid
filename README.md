# **Welcome to my Laboratory**

**I am:** Lia da Graça (@Lia-droid)

• PhD in Sciences (AI for Health) UNIFESP
• Visiting PhD Researcher – Universidad de Alicante 
• MSc. Organizational Networks UNIP
• MBA Exchange (Visiting MSc.) – ESADE Business School, Barcelona
• Alma Mater: Fundação Getúlio Vargas EAESP 

Project Manager working on Artificial Intelligence applied to strategic systems,
critical care predictions and forecasting, public health,
and defence-oriented preparedness for outbreaks, disasters, and complex scenarios.

**My research includes:**

• AI-driven ICU triage and resource allocation  
• Predictive modeling using national-scale health datasets  
• Reproducible computational infrastructures for translational decision support  
• Transition from classical AI to Quantum AI approaches, including  
  quantum-enhanced time-series prediction and hybrid Qu-AI algorithms  

I am currently exploring and developing quantum-inspired and variational
quantum models (e.g., QLSTM / VQC-based architectures) as part of this transition.

Currently developing my project for post-doctoral research, scientific articles,
and method-oriented research frameworks.
