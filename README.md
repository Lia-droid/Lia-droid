# **Welcome to Lia-droid**

**I am:** Lia da Graça (@Lia-droid)

• PhD in Sciences (AI for Health)  
• MSc. Organizational Networks  

Project Manager working on Artificial Intelligence applied to strategic systems,
critical care, public health, and strategic preparedness for outbreaks,
disasters, and defence-related scenarios.

**My research includes:**

• AI-driven ICU triage and resource allocation  
• Predictive modeling using national-scale health datasets  
• Reproducible computational infrastructures for translational decision support  
• Transition from classical AI to Quantum AI approaches, including  
  quantum-enhanced time-series prediction and hybrid Qu-AI algorithms  

I am currently exploring and developing quantum-inspired and variational
quantum models (e.g., QLSTM / VQC-based architectures) as part of this transition.

Currently developing my project for post-doctoral research, scientific articles,
and method-oriented research frameworks.
