Hi, I’m Lia da Graca (@Lia-droid)

I am a Project Manager working on Artificial Intelligence applied to strategic systems, critical care, public health,
and strategic preparedness for outbreaks, disasters, and defence-related scenarios.

My research includes:

• AI-driven ICU triage and resource allocation  
• Predictive modeling using national-scale health datasets  
• Reproducible computational infrastructures for translational decision support  
• Transition from classical AI to Quantum AI approaches, including
  quantum-enhanced time-series prediction and hybrid Qu-AI algorithms  

I am currently exploring and developing quantum-inspired and variational
quantum models (e.g., QLSTM / VQC-based architectures) as part of this transition.

Currently developing my project for post-doctoral research, scientific articles and method-oriented research frameworks.
