Hi, I’m Lia da Graca (@Lia-droid)

Project Manager. My work focuses on:

• AI-driven ICU triage, mortality, and length of stay prediction  
• Large-scale public health datasets (e.g., SRAG / INFLUD – Brazil)  
• Reproducible computational methods and decision-support systems  
• Strategic applications of AI and quantum-inspired approaches in defence contexts  

I am the Research Lead in Quantum Technologies and Vice Lead of AI at the
Laboratory of Simulations and Scenarios (LSC),
Naval War School (EGN-Brazil), working on foresight, defence-related scenarios,
and complex systems under stress.
Currently working on peer-reviewed articles, postdoctoral project and method-oriented research projects.
